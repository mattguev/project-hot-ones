# project-hot-ones

1. Who has the most songs on the Hot 100 this week? (unfortunately not Taylor Swift)

2. Does Bo Burnham's stereotype of country music as "mad libs and mandolins" hold true?

3. What do Mariah Carey and Santa Claus have in common? Curious patterns in the trajectory of Number 1 hits. 

This project provides visualizations to help answer those questions using the Spotify and Billboard APIs!
